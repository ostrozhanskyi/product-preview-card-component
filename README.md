## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

Using <button> tag for non-navigational buttons are preferred.
You can add svg to your HTML in a couple of different ways but not all of them support styling afterwards. 


### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Great resource for HTML and CSS references
- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) - Great thing to ask questions about some tricky situations but you shouldn't rely on it too much for learning purposes
